# _CODEBOOK_

Codebook is a hobby project that I created with two purposes. One being the quest of mastering the MERN stack and the other being that I wanted to make my own social media platform. The Codebook name can be somewhat misleading since some may believe it's a social platform for developers. My own vision for it is to be a social platform for adventurers and outdoor people. And my target audience is going to be my family and maybe some close friends.

## Techniques

I have built all the APIs and backend using Node.js and Express. As a database I'm using MongoDB since it’s the MERN stack I'm pursuing. For the client I have used NextJS and in the client I also set up with redux to easier keep track of states.

## DEPLOYMENT

This website will be deployed at the domain of my family name. If you feel encouraged to share your adventures don’t hesitate to join the community today! The link below will start your own adventure.
